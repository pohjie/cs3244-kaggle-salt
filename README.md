# cs3244-kaggle-salt
This is the code for a group project whereby we joined the TGS Salt Idenfication Kaggle competition. 

In this competition, we are given 4000 greyscale images, along with csv files that annotate the position of salt in each image. Our output will be to indicate the exact pixel locations where there is salt in each of the test image.

The code for logistic regression, support vector machine and CNN are all written by me.

The code for the U-net is the product of Peter HÃ¶nigschmid, whereby the goal for the group was to understand the structure of U-net and the hyperparameters involved in its construction.
